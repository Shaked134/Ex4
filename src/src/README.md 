 # # 📊 Ex4 - Object-Oriented Spreadsheet System (Advanced)



## 📘 Overview

This project extends a basic object-oriented spreadsheet system written in Java, originally designed in **Ex2**, by adding:

- 📐 Range support (e.g., `A1:C5`)
- 🧮 Built-in functions: `sum`, `min`, `max`, `average`
- 🔁 Conditional expressions using `if(...)`
- 🚫 Error handling (syntax and circular dependencies)

 #### in EX2:
- Text (e.g., "Hello", "123abc")
- Numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14, -5)
- Formulas (e.g., =A1+2, =B2/(A3*2))

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧾 1. Initialization
A spreadsheet is created with default size (e.g. 9x17), and all cells are initialized as empty.

### ⌨️ 2. Input
User can enter:
- Plain text
- Numbers
- Formulas (including references, functions, and if-conditions)

### ➗ 3. Formula Evaluation
- Supports arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Supports parentheses and nested expressions
- Resolves references recursively

 ### 4. Error Detection:
  - If a formula contains invalid syntax (e.g., =1++2, =sum(A1:B2), it is flagged with ERR_FORM!.

- If a formula introduces a circular reference (e.g., A1 → B1 → C1 → A1), it is flagged with ERR_CYCLE!.

- If a formula references a cell that contains an error, the error is propagated to the current cell (e.g., if A1 = ERR_FORM!, then =A1+2 also results in ERR_FORM!).

- If a function (e.g., sum, average) is called with a malformed range or includes non-numeric values, the function returns ERR_FORM!.

- If an if condition is not valid (e.g., =if(Hello, 1, 2)), it is also flagged with ERR_FORM!.

## 📐 Example
A1 = 5
A2 = =A1+3 → 8
A3 = =if(A2>6, "BIG", "SMALL") → "BIG"
A4 = =sum(A1:A2) → 13.0
A5 = =A5+1 → ERR_CYCLE!

## 🧪 Testing
The program is tested using JUnit. Tests cover:

- ✅ Input parsing
- 🔁 Recursive formula resolution
- ❗ Error propagation
- 🧠 Depth calculation
- 📦 Range handling

## 💾 Save & Load
Spreadsheet supports saving and loading `.csv` files:

- Only non-empty cells are saved
- Supports reloading a saved spreadsheet session
