 #  Ex4 - Object-Oriented Spreadsheet System (Advanced):


 ## Overview:

This project extends a basic object-oriented spreadsheet system written in Java, originally designed in Ex2, by introducing advanced features such as:
Range support (e.g., A1:C5)

Built-in functions (sum, min, max, average)

Conditional expressions using if(...)

Improved error handling and dependency management

Each cell in the spreadsheet can hold:

Plain text (e.g., "Hello", "abc123")

Numeric values (e.g., 42, -3.5)

Formulas (e.g., =A1+2, =sum(B2:C4), =if(A1>0, 1, 0))

The system supports dynamic evaluation, error propagation, circular dependency detection, and maintains the computational depth of cells.
